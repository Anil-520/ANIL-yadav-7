## Interview Question Answers
1. **What is a VPN?**  
A VPN is a Virtual Private Network that encrypts internet traffic and hides your IP.
2. **How does a VPN protect privacy?**  
By masking your IP and encrypting traffic so ISPs or hackers can't read it.
3. **VPN vs Proxy:**  
VPN encrypts all traffic, proxy only routes specific app/browser traffic.
4. **Encryption in VPN:**  
VPNs use encryption like AES-256 to secure transmitted data.
5. **Complete anonymity?**  
No — VPNs help, but browsing habits, cookies, and accounts can reveal identity.
6. **Protocols used:**  
OpenVPN, WireGuard, IKEv2/IPSec.
7. **Limitations:**  
Reduced speed, possible logging, blocked by some services.
8. **Effect on speed:**
